Run `configs_train_test_split.py` to split the entire dataset into training and test sets.
This script will create a JSON file `configs_train_test.json` that contains the information of each set.
It will also copy the training and test configuration sets into `carbon_training_set` and `carbon_test_set`, respectively.
