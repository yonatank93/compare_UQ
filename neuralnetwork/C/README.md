* First, look at `training_dropout` to train the model and get dropout ensembles.
* Then, go to `fim` to compute the uncertainty using a Gaussian ensemble defined by the
  FIM.
* After that, you can go to `bootstrap` and `random_init` to get the ensembles using
  bootstrap and different random initialization.
