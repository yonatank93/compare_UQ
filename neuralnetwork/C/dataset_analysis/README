# WARNING - DON'T DELETE THIS FOLDER FROM BOLYAI

The file ``umap_reducer.pkl`` was exported from the trained reducer, which was
trained in Bolyai. This file can be use to load the reducer, but it seems to be
machine specific. The environment in RC doesn't seem to be able to load the
reducer from this file.
