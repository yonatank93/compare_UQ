In this folder, I want to test LAMMPS scripts to compute the cohesive energy of graphene.
Eventually, I want to turn this into a script to compute the energy vs lattice constant
curve for graphene. However, I still have some initial steps to do before that.
* [X] Generate initial atomic position for graphene, 1 unit cell first.
* [X] Generate a script to generate large sheet of graphene.
* [X] Get a lammps script to do relaxation.
* [X] Get lattice constant using 1 unit cell.
* [X] Get lattice constant using large sheet of graphene.
* [X] Compress and stretch 1 dimension and relax the other dimensions.
